# ðŸ§  SOLACE â€“ Student Outlook on Lifestyle, Academics, and Challenges through Exploration

**SOLACE** is a data-driven R project designed to analyze lifestyle, academic habits, and stress levels among students. By leveraging data visualization, text mining, and statistical analysis, it aims to uncover patterns that can inform well-being interventions and foster academic success.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Objectives

- Analyze the relationship between sleep hours, study hours, and stress levels.
- Identify the most challenging subjects reported by students.
- Visualize trends and distributions using graphs and plots.
- Use text mining to interpret emotional responses.
- Provide personalized stress-level predictions based on user inputs.
- Offer evidence-based well-being recommendations.

## ðŸ“‚ Files

- `data.csv` â€“ Raw input dataset (from Google Forms).
- `data_cleaned.csv` â€“ Cleaned and processed dataset.
- `summary_stats.csv` â€“ Aggregated summary statistics.
- `solace_analysis.R` â€“ Main R script for data analysis, visualization, prediction, and reporting.

## ðŸ”§ Technologies & Libraries Used

- **R** (base)
- `readr`, `dplyr` â€“ Data handling and transformation
- `ggplot2` â€“ Visualizations
- `tm`, `wordcloud` â€“ Text mining and word cloud generation
- `RColorBrewer`, `forcats` â€“ Aesthetic enhancements and factor handling
- `nnet` â€“ Multinomial prediction (if used)
- `shiny` â€“ Interactive dashboard (optional)

## ðŸ“Š Features

### âœ… Data Visualizations
- Histogram of sleep hours
- Bar chart of top 10 most difficult subjects
- Scatter plot of sleep vs. stress
- Pie chart of stress categories
- Box plot of study hours by stress level
- Gender-wise stress distribution

### ðŸ§  Predictive Logic
- Rule-based stress level predictor using user input (sleep & study hours)
- Detailed scientific and practical explanations for each prediction

### ðŸ’¬ Text Analysis
- Word cloud generated from students' stress descriptions
- Random suggestion of well-being tips from student responses

### ðŸ§ª Correlation
- Pearson correlation between sleep hours and stress level, with interpretation

## ðŸš€ How to Run

1. Install R and RStudio (if not already installed).
2. Ensure required libraries are installed by running:

   ```r
   packages <- c("readr", "dplyr", "ggplot2", "tm", "wordcloud", "RColorBrewer", "forcats", "shiny", "nnet")
   new.packages <- packages[!(packages %in% installed.packages()[,"Package"])]
   if(length(new.packages)) install.packages(new.packages, dependencies=TRUE)
